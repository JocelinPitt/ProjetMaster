These files are previous work that I've done in order to attempt to build a deep learning model for personality detection on fictional characters.
Those are seperated into three categories:

* First, my early attempt that I've done on Google Colabs. Those files are very messy and most of them doesn't work anymore.
* Then an attempt to perform sentimental analysis.
* Lastly, some tries that I've done on building my own Keras model. All those file begin with a small description of what they're supposed to do. But they're not fully commented.
