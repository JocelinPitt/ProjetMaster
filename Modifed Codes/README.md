Those files are sightly modified version of Y. Mehta's work. 
You should substitute those with their homonym in order to pass the "MyData" option into the LM_extractor calls.
But these modifications will also allow you to save the models you are training.

You should find them into the following directories of [Y. Mehta's GitHub repository](https://github.com/yashsmehta/personality-prediction)
* data_utils.py and dataset_processors goes into the utils directory
* MLP_LM_saved goes into the model directory
* LM_extractor goes into the root directory
